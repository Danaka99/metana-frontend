Subject: Apology for Incomplete Project Submission

Dear Sir/Madom,

I hope this message finds you well. I sincerely apologize for not completing the website project as requested. Due to exams at university, I was unable to finalize the project and only managed to develop the front end of the first page.

I saw your email later than I had hoped. I have attached a GitHub link to the current progress, and I plan to continue modifying the site in the future.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
